<h2 align="center"><a href="https://status.bain.cz/">status.bain.cz</a></h2>
Status page for all my services. Inspired by cState, and hosted on GitHub pages because hosting it myself is a stupid idea (and i don't want to pay extra for it).

It is automatically built and deployed by GitHub actions on every push to the `src` dir. A separate [status monitor](https://git.bain.cz/monitor/log.html) is set up to automatically commit new incidents, and notify me when a service goes offline.
